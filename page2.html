<ul>
<li> Number 15- Cucumber Lime- This flavor is actually ranked much higher than I originally was going to rank it, but I tasted it again and it was sweeter than I remebered and the cucumber wasn't as prominent. But this flavor still isn't great. <br> <img src="https://www.snackoree.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/800x800/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/g/_/g_limecuke_20.png.750x750_q85ss0_progressive_1.png" height=250>  </li>
<li> Number 14- Fruit Punch- This is contreversial. I know. It's most peoples favorite flavor. I don't like this flavor. It's the worst Fruit Punch flavored thing. <br> <img src= "https://www.pepsicobeveragefacts.com/content/image/products/G_FruitPunch_20oz.png?r=20180717" height=250> </li>
<li> Number 13- Mixed Berry- This flavor is basically just fruit punch with a little more flavor.Also this bottle looks empty. <br> <img src= "http://www.pepsicobeveragefacts.com/content/image/products/G2_MxdBerry_12.png?r=20190826" height=250 </li>
<li> Number 12- Glacier Freeze- This  one is mediocre. It just don't have anything that makes the flavor stand out, and I dont even know what flavor it's trying to be so... <br> <img src= "https://dqzrr9k4bjpzk.cloudfront.net/images/11153408/489852188.jpg" height=250 </li>
<li> Number 11- Orange- I have never really liked orange flavored things. So it's no suprise i don't like this flavor that much. <br> <img src= "https://www.gatorade.com/assets/data/sku-images/603290/603290_04_small-product.png" height=250</li> 
<li> Number 10- Blackberry Wave- Blackberry is my favorite fruit, this doesn't do it much justice, although it's an okay flavor. <br> <img src= "http://www.pepsicobeveragefacts.com/content/image/products/GFlow_Blackberry_20.png?r=20180917" height=250</li>
<li> Number 9- Riptide Rush- Basically grape with less flavor, I like grape, this is just less flavor <br> <img src= "https://www.gatorade.com/assets/data/sku-images/603355/603355_02_small-product.png" height=250</li>    
<li> Number 8- Grape- Just like riptide rush with more flavor. This is the first flavor that I genuinally enjoy and will seek it out to drink. <br> <img src= "http://www.pepsicobeveragefacts.com/content/image/products/G_FierceGrape_32oz.png?r=20190604" height= 250</li>
<li> Number 7- Strawberry- This flavor is suprisingly good for being organic. Strawberry is an accurate repersentation of the fruit. <br> <img src= "https://www.gatorade.com/assets/data/sku-images/447576/447576_00_small.png" height=250 </li>
<li> Number 6- Glacier Cherry- I don't like cherry flavored things. This is unlike any others, this is the best cherry flavored thing Iv'e ever tasted. Still isn't the best flavor. <br> <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/63/57/bc/6357bcebfdc8bba576ea60e4c9cc3ac1.png" height=250 </li>
